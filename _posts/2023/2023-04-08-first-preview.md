title: "Katelog #3: A first preview release!"
---

This was a kind of hectic month in many aspects, but things should be moving at a reasonable pace again. From my side, this marks the release of the [remake of my O2A2 game](https://qteatime.itch.io/the-sound-of-rain-remake), as well as the release of the very first [Kate Preview version](https://github.com/qteatime/kate#kate).

You can run it from [https://kate.qteati.me](https://kate.qteati.me) on any device with a modern browser, or install it from npm and run it from the command line (you want the experimental tag of [@qteatime/kate-desktop](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@qteatime/kate-desktop)).

Safer alternatives to local installation will come soon (I'm looking into at least releasing it as [sandboxed Snaps on Linux](https://snapcraft.io/) and sandboxed Windows Store appx, a sandboxed MacOS app might also happen in the future). Check [the install instructions](https://github.com/qteatime/kate#installation) for current alternative installation modes. Here's how it looks like once you're running it:

Besides the [example cartridges](https://github.com/qteatime/kate#examples) in the repository, [the sound of rain](https://qteatime.itch.io/the-sound-of-rain-remake) also includes a cartridge download that you can load in the console. Hopefully more coming soon, but there's still quite a bit that needs to happen in terms of developer documentation before I start trying to get people in this :)

Though, speaking of documentation, I did start writing [a user manual](https://github.com/qteatime/kate/blob/main/docs/user-manual.md) and [a developer manual](https://github.com/qteatime/kate/blob/main/docs/dev-manual.md), so work's definitely happening on that front!

Next update should be sometime in May, see you then :>

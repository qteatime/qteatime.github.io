title: "Katelog #2: Mascots and more"
---

Continuing the weekly-ish updates on my projects, this time we're talking about... mascots?

As you can imagine [I am a big fan of anthropomorphic mascots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-tan) for computer things, so it's only fair that I give my own software their own humanoid personifications. [Crochet](https://crochet.qteati.me) has one, inspired by [Forest Girl/Mori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_street_fashion#Mori_Kei) fashion and with autumnal colours to give that safe, cozy feeling.

For Kate I wanted something that felt like it could have been there in the 2000s, because the fantasy console is trying to capture that era as well. But I also wanted something that felt cozy and safe, because those are likewise things that Kate as a console aims to be.

The design I ended up on was a girl with cat ears, asymmetric socks, a backpack carried on one shoulder, and very baggy clothing. The palette mimics Kate's own palette, and the style is loosely inspired by things you'd have seen in the [FRUiTS](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruits_(magazine)>) magazine of that era, as well as how me and my friends dressed then, but I tried being a bit less overbearing with the accessories so the silhouette and the associations read a bit better.

Ultimately, both Kate-chan's aesthetics and the kind of feelings Kate as a console aims to evoke are a product of the 2000s and early 2010s era, so I'm reasonably happy with how she turned out.

Mascots weren't the only thing happening in Kate the past couple of weeks, though. The two big ones were proper network sandboxing and the redone RPG Maker bridge.

Network sandboxing means that a cartridge can't make HTTP calls. Having this as a default makes a lot of problems with running cartridges downloaded from random places go away. At worst, malicious cartridges can hog your memory and CPU, and the browser will kill the whole tab. Which _is_ annoying, but not dangerous like having the cartridge steal your online accounts.

The RPG Maker bridge makes it possible to package games built in RPG Maker MV as-is, and have them work locally in Kate without additional effort. The bridge translates regular Web APIs into Kate APIs under the hood, so all resources are loaded from the cartridge binary, and no HTTP calls are made. That's all the benefits of regular OS executables without their lack of basic security!
